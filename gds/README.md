# Python + R: `gds`

The `gds` flavour contains a full [`gds_py`](../gds_py) stack, as well as an entire R stack.  The R stack is available within Jupyter Lab, and the list of libraries is designed to closely mirror that provided by the excellent [`rocker/geospatial`](https://github.com/rocker-org/geospatial) project.
