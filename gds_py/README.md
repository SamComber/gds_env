# Python: `gds_py`

The core of the `gds_env` is `gds_py`: a container providing a fully working, state-of-the-art Jupyter Lab installation, additionally loaded with a comprehensive list of geospatial python packages.

## Native `conda` version

From `gds_py`, an [environment file](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env/raw/master/gds_py/gds_py.yml) is automatically created for the stack built using `conda`. This is then tested on Windows/macOS/Linux:
